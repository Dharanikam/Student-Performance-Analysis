# Student-Performance-Analysis
Student Performance Analysis using Python

Student Performance Analysis is a data-driven approach to understanding how students perform academically by examining factors such as attendance, study hours, assessments, backlogs, department, year of study, and access to internet resources. This project uses exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques to uncover patterns, identify performance gaps, and provide actionable academic insights that support better learning outcomes and informed educational decision-making.

Objective

To identify meaningful patterns, trends, and insights related to student academic performance using exploratory data analysis (EDA).

To clean, transform, and preprocess the student performance dataset for accurate and reliable analysis.

To create meaningful visualizations that clearly explain relationships between academic factors and performance.

To provide actionable insights and recommendations to improve student outcomes and reduce academic risk.

Data Pre-processing

The analysis process began with data preprocessing, where the uncleaned student performance dataset was carefully prepared for analysis. Duplicate records were removed, missing values were handled appropriately, and inconsistencies in categorical columns such as gender, internet access, and backlogs were corrected. Numerical columns were cleaned, data types were standardized, and outliers were reviewed where necessary. These steps ensured that the dataset was accurate, consistent, and ready for meaningful analysis using Python.

Note: Kind of Analysis to be Done
Type of Analysis
Descriptive Analysis (Summarizing the Dataset)

Analyzes historical student data to understand overall academic performance, attendance patterns, study habits, department-wise outcomes, and demographic distribution.

Diagnostic Analysis (Finding Reasons Behind Patterns)

Identifies the factors influencing student performance, such as attendance levels, study hours, assessment scores, department differences, and year-wise performance variations.

Predictive Analysis (Optional – Basic Forecasting)

Uses observed trends in attendance, study hours, backlogs, and assessment scores to predict students who may be at academic risk or likely to perform poorly in future assessments.

Prescriptive Analysis (Recommendations for Academic Decisions)

Provides data-backed recommendations such as targeted academic support, improved attendance monitoring, remedial classes, and enhanced digital access to improve student performance and reduce backlogs.
